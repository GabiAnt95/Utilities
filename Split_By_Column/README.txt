		---------------- UTILITY -------------------

With this script we get to split a given Excel by the unique
values of a given column.

For example, for a given Excel with 8 columns which one of them if "Country"
where there are 5 Uniques Values: Spain, Jamaica, Belice, Guinea and Congo.
We will receive 5 Excels (One for each country) with the 8 columns 
but only with the data of each country.

There is an Excel Example in the folder INPUTS. (Delete before use the script)
